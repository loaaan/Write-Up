# ELK stack

## What is ELK stack? 

>Is an acronym used to describe a stack that compromises three projects: Elastic Search, Logstash and Kibana.

The E stands for `elasticsearch` which is a distributed search and analytics engine, allows you to store, search and analyze large amounts of data quickly. 
The L stands for `logstash`, this is an open-source data processing pipeline tool, it collects, process and forwards log data.
The K stands for `kibana`, this is a data visualization and exploration tool.

So basically `logstash` works as a delivery guy on his scooter, delivering food made by the kitchen of many restaurants (`elasticsearch`) you tell them what you want and they can prepare it really quick but it is only accessible through the desktop, which is `kibana`. Or something like that.
